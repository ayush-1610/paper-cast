# paper-cast

I am building a product called Mximoph, the USP of this product is  the ability to create a curated podcast based on your research paper (documents). Instead of slogging through a dense research paper, you can listen to two AI voices have a conversation, summarizing it.

This can be a game-changer for busy professionals or students who want to digest information while multitasking.

You could get personalized news podcasts, custom book summaries, or even an audio breakdown of any research paper? This could be a glimpse into the future of content consumption, where we’re listening to custom content created just for us.

This feature is more than just text-to-speech software—the podcast is not a verbal transcription. Instead, it’s a conversation between two hosts discussing the key points of the documents. The format is really like listening to a podcast. The voices are remarkably human and emotive.
