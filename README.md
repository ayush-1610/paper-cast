# PaperCast: AI-Powered Research Paper to Podcast Converter
PaperCast transforms complex academic papers into engaging audio content, bridging the gap between scholarly research and accessible knowledge consumption. By leveraging advanced NLP and text-to-speech technologies, it converts arXiv research papers into conversational podcasts, making scientific knowledge more approachable and digestible for a broader audience.

In today's fast-paced world, staying current with academic research can be challenging. PaperCast addresses this by:

- Converting dense academic text into natural, engaging dialogue
- Making research accessible during commutes or other hands-busy moments
- Breaking down complex concepts into digestible conversations
- Democratizing access to scientific knowledge

## Technicalities
PaperCast demonstrates sophisticated integration of multiple AI technologies:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Employs advanced summarization and key-point extraction using transformers and spaCy
- **Conversational AI**: Generates natural dialogue between virtual hosts
- **Text-to-Speech Synthesis**: Creates human-like voice output with proper pacing and intonation
- **Document Processing**: Handles complex academic PDF structures and formatting

## Features
The system orchestrates a seamless pipeline:

1. **Paper Discovery**: Intelligent arXiv paper fetching based on user queries
2. **Content Processing**: Multi-stage text analysis and summarization
3. **Dialogue Generation**: Creation of natural, engaging conversations
4. **Audio Synthesis**: High-quality voice generation with natural flow

## Architecture
PaperCast employs a modern, modular architecture:
